Valerian root extract consists of the fresh or carefully dried subterranean parts of Valeriana officinalis L. including the rhizome, roots and stolons.",
    "pharmacology": "5-Hydroxytryptophan (5HTP) is decarboxylated \"in vivo\" to yield serotonin, a neuro-hormonal transmitter released by neurons in the brain, spinal cord and symphatetic ganglia. Its seed contains active drug 5-hydroxytryptophan (5HTP). 5HTP is an aromatic amino acid naturally produced by the body from the essential amino acid L-tryptophan. Produced commercially by extraction from the seeds of the African plant Griffonia simplicifolia. Valerian extract is effective in treating mild-to-moderate sleeping disorders without adverse effects on REM sleep and without significant hangover effects. Valerian has a sedative-hypnotics, anxiolytic, antidepressant, anticonvulsant and antispasmodic effects.5HTP acts primarily by within the centralesing levels of serotonin nervous system. Other neurotransmitters and CNS chemicals, such as melatonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, and beta endorphin have also been shown to increase following oral administration of 5HTP.Valepotriate binds to dopamine receptors. Valerenic acid also appears to inhibit the enzyme system responsible for the central catabolism of GABA, increasing GABA concentration and decreasing CNS activities.Valerian extracts containing amino acids and valerenic acid bind with the GABA-A receptor. In the brain cortex.Extract of Valerian inhibits the uptake and stimulates the release of GABA, leading to increase concentration of GABA in synaptic clefts. Valerenic acid may increasing inhibit enzymes that break down GABA, thus GABA levels and producing CNS-depressing effect.",

    "composition": "",
    "description": "",
    "pharmacology": "Folate is a water-soluble vitamin B, which functions as a coenzyme or co-substrate in the synthesis of DNA and RNA and metabolism of amino acids. Deficiency is common during pregnancy which may lead to fetal malformations such as neural tube defects. Inadequate maternal folate status has also been associated with low infant birth weight, preterm delivery, and fetal growth retardation. Spina-bifi- da and anencephaly are the most common neural tube defects (NTDs). Folic acid supplementation before conception and during the first trimester has been shown to reduce the recurrence of NTDs in women. Supplementation is used to treat megaloblastic anemia during pregnancy. Folate (68-5-methyltetrahydrofolate) is the fourth generation folate derivatives, a new generation of folic acid derivative made up of (6S-5-methyltetrahydrofolate) and glucosamine salt which is readily active and has added advantage of higher bioavailability, safety and stability.",
    "dosage": "1-2 Capsule daily or as directed by the physician.",
    "interaction": "Folate (6s-5-methyltetrahydrofolate) may show possible drug interactions. Anticonvulsant action of phenytoin is antagonized by Folic Acid. Folate deficiency may result from increased loss of folate, as in renal dialysis and/or interference with metabolism (e.g., Folic Acid antagonists such as Methotrex- ate); the administration of anticonvulsants, such as diphenylhydantoin, primidone, and barbiturates; alcohol consumption and, especially alcoholic cirrhosis; and the administration of pyrimethamine and, nitrofurantoin. Taking Folate (6s-5-methyltetrahydrofolate) along with amiodarone might increase the chances of sunburn, blistering, or rashes on areas of skin exposed to sunlight. Folate (6s-5-methyltetrahydrofolate) might increase breaks down of phenobarbital leading to decrease the effectiveness of phenobarbital.",
    "contraindications": "Folate (6s-5-methyltetrahydrofolate) is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients.",
    "side_effects": "Folate (6s-5-methyltetrahydrofolate) may have some side effects. It's best to consult a doctor first before starting this medication.",
    "pregnancy_cat": "Use in pregnancy is considered safely acceptable. Folic acid is actively secreted in breast milk. Supplementation in lactating women may be needed if poor nutritional habits lead to maternal deficiency and megaloblastic anemia. The American Academy of Pediatrics considers folic acid compatible with breast feeding.",
    "precautions": "Folic acid alone is inadequate therapy in the treatment of pernicious anemia and other megaloblastic anemias where Vitamin B12 is deficient. Folic acid in doses above 0.1 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia in that hematologic remission can occur while neurological manifestations progress. While prescribing this nutritional supplement for pregnant women, nursing mothers or for women prior to conception, their medical condition and any drugs, herbs and/or supplements consumption should be considered.",

    "description": "Andrographis paniculata is a herbaceous plant of acanthaceae family, native to India and Sri Lanka. Its common name is Kalomegh. It is widely cultivated in Southern Asia, where it is used to treat infections and some diseases, often being used before antibiotics were created. Mostly the leaves and roots were used for medicinal purposes.",
    "pharmacology": "Andrographis compounds have shown antiviral properties which appear to inhibit glycoproteins in the virus. This impedes the ability of viruses to invade cells and replicate. It also has a major effect activating the general defense functions of the immune system by stimulating the production of antibodies as well as non-specific immune responses such as increased macrophage phagocytosis, rather than by any direct antimicrobial activity. Andrographis has flavonoids, which always have an anti-inflammatory effect. In vitro studies have shown that the flavonoid activities suppressed the genetic expression of neutrophils. Similarly, studies have indicated that a variety of inflammatory proteins, including COX-2, are reduced by the presence of Andrographoloid.The aerial parts and their constituent andrographolides have antihepato-toxic activity in vitro and in vivo. In vitro studies have shown that intraperitoneal administration of a methanol extract of the aerial parts to mice reduced hepatotoxicity induced by carbon tetrachloride CCl4, and reversed CCl4 induced histopathological changes in the liver. Intraperitoneal administration of andrographolide to mice inhibited the CCl4 induced increase in the activity of serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase, serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin and hepatic triglycerides. Andrographolide, the major antihepatotoxic component of the plant, exerted a pronounced protective effect in rats against hepato-toxicity induced by CCl4, Dgalactosamine, paracetamol and ethanol.Moreover, andrographolide and related diterpenes are choleretic, antidiarrheal, immunostimulant, antimalarial, antipyretic and active in urinary tract infections.",

    "composition": "",
    "description": "",
    "pharmacology": "This is a safe and effective indigenous drug prepared from the scientifically drawn extract of Areca catechu. One hundred patients of cerebrovascular diseases (CVD) with various disabilities were studied to see the effects of Areca Catechu. Fifty patients (interventions) were given Areca Catechu and fifty other patients (control)were treated with the conventional vasodilators. The male-female ratio was 4:1. As usual physiotherapy was given to both group of patients. The result of the treatment showed that unconscious patients regained consciousness and the dysphasic patients started speaking much earlier than those of the control group. The improvement in the activity of daily living and recovery of micturition control were earlier. The Areca Catechu was also useful in patients with chronic CVD due to atherosclerosis.The probable mode of action of Areca catechu on CVD patients may be presumed as follows : by improving circulation of the brain, by direct stimulating of the brain cell, by improving metabolism and nutrition of the brain cells, by the combination of the above mechanisms. Arecoline and other alkaloids in the Areca Catechu which are known as parasympathomimetic agents might have improved circulation of the brain by dilating cerebral blood vessels, thereby increasing blood flow. Areca Catechu contains many essential amino acids and other essential nutrients or some unidentified factors which may improve the metabolism of the brain. This may also be due to direct stimulation of the brain by the alkaloids present in Areca Catechu.",

Major active constituents of Chaste berry are iridoid glycosides such as agnuside, aucubin and flavonoids such as casticin. Chaste berry acts as a hormonal modulator by increasing progesterone levels with the corresponding reduction in estrogen levels via the corpus luteum hormone effect. It shows central action at the pituitary gland that inhibits the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), promotes the release of luteinizing hormone (LH), and decreases prolactin secretion by the pituitary gland via dopamine antagonistic effect. It is also used for fibrocystic breast, insufficient lactation, corpus luteum insufficiency, prevention of miscarriage in the first trimester of pregnancy in cases of progesterone insufficiency and acne vulgaris.",

    "composition": "",
    "description": "",
    "pharmacology": "The USP refers to Coenzyme Q10 as Ubidecarenone which is a fat-soluble vitamin like substance. It is presented in every cell of the body and acts as a vital intermediate of the electron transport system in the mitochondrial membrane for cellular respiration and ATP production. The highest requirement of Ubidecarenone is found in the cells and tissues that are of metabolically active such as- heart, immune system, skeleton muscle, gingiva and most susceptible to Ubidecarenone deficiency. The Production of Ubidecarenone slows down with advancing age and thus contribute in manifestation of aging.As Ubidecarenone is a lipophilic substance, it is absorbed less on an empty stomach and absorbed in greater amount when taken with food of high lipid content. Thus, after oral administration, Ubidecarenone is absorbed from the small intestine into the lymphatics system and then taken up by the liver where it is incorporated into lipoproteins and released into the blood circulation and at that time concentrated in the tissues.Ubidecarenone is distributed to the various tissues of the body and is able to enter into the brain. The concentration varies from tissue to tissue and those with high rates of metabolic activity and high energy demands such as heart, muscle, liver, kidney and brain contain relatively high concentration of Ubidecarenone. Ubidecarenone is metabolized in all tissues in the body. Approximately 60% of an oral dose of Ubidecarenone is excreted in the feces. The main elimination of Ubidecarenone occurs with bile.",
    "dosage": "For Co-enzyme Q10 deficiency: 150 mg daily.For mitochondrial disorders: 150-160 mg, or 2 mg/kg/day. For heart failure in adults: 100 mg per day divided into 2 or 3 doses.For recent myocardial infarction: 120 mg daily in 2 divided doses.For high blood pressure: 120-200 mg per day divided into 2 doses.For isolated systolic hypertension: 60 mg twice daily.For preventing migraine headache: 100 mg three times daily. For Parkinson's disease: 300 mg, 600 mg, 1200 mg and 2400 mg per day in 3-4 divided doses.For infertility in men: 200-300 mg per day.For muscular dystrophy: 100 mg per day.Dividing the total daily dose by taking smaller amounts two or three times a day instead of a large amount all at once can help to reduce side effects.",
    "interaction": "Statins: The statin drugs reduce endogenous synthesis of Ubidecarenone in the body. Thus, Ubidecarenone supplement may increase Ubidecarenone levels without adversely affecting statin drug's efficacy.Warfarin: May reduce the effectiveness of warfarin.Beta-blockers: Beta blockers (particularly propanolol) have been reported to inhibit some Ubidecarenone dependent enzymes,Antidiabetic medications: May improve glycemic control in some type II diabetics. If this occurred, antidiabetic medications may need appropriate dose adjustment. Doxorubicin: May help ameliorate the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin।",

Vitamin E protects polyunsaturated fatty acids which are components of cellular membrane and other oxygen-sensitive substances such as vitamin A & vitamin C from oxidation. Vitamin E reacts with free radicals, which is the cause of oxidative damage to cell membranes, without the formation of another free radical in the process. The main pharmacological action of vitamin E in humans is its antioxidant effect.In premature neonates, irritability, edema, thrombosis and hemolytic anemia may be caused due to vitamin E deficiency. Creatinuria, ceroid deposition, muscle weakness, decreased erythrocyte survival or increased in vitro hemolysis by oxidizing agents have been identified in adults and children with low serum tocopherol concentrations.The usage of vitamin E eliminates its deficiency. About 20% to 80% of vitamin E is absorbed in the digestive tract and for adequate absorption of vitamin E, it requires bile and fast.

Read moreBack pain: Taking devil's claw by mouth seems to reduce low-back pain. Devil's claw seems to work about as well as some non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).Osteoarthritis: Taking devil's claw alone or along with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) seems to help decrease osteoarthritis-related pain. Some evidence suggests that devil's claw works about as well as diacerhein (a slow-acting drug for osteoarthritis that is not available in the U.S.) for improving osteoarthritis pain in the hip and knee after 16 weeks of treatment. Some people taking devil's claw seem to be able to lower the dose of NSAIDs they need for pain relief. This evidence comes from a study that used a specific powdered devil's claw root product (Harpadol, Arkopharma) containing 2% of the devil's claw ingredient harpagoside (9.5 mg/capsule) and 3% total iridoid glycosides (14.5 mg per capsule).

    "description": "The medicinal parts are the whole fresh bulb, the dried bulb and the oil of Garlic. Garlic contains alliin and its transformation products and sulfur containing essential oil. Garlic oil is not present in fresh or dried garlic bulbs, instead the oil is produced by converting water-soluble thiosulfinates to oil-soluble sulfides via steam distillation. Central to Southern Asia is considered the region of origin. Garlic has been harvested in September and October when the leaves and bulbs are dry. In the United States and Western Europe, garlic is one of the most popular substances used to reduce various risks associated with cardiovascular disease. Garlic preparations have been one of the top-selling herbal supplements in the U.S. market for many years.",
    "pharmacology": "Garlic reduces total cholesterol (TC), serum triglycerides (TG) and elevates high density lipoproteins (HDL). It prevents platelet aggregation and thrombus formation, stimulates fibrinolysis, prolongs clotting time, reduces low density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation. It also reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressure and attenuates age and blood pressure related increases in aortic stiffness and reduces blood glucose levels.\n\nSteroid saponins interfere with the absorption of total and LDL cholesterol from the intestinal lumen, thereby reducing plasma cholesterol level without adversely affecting HDL levels.\nIncreases catabolism of fatty acid-containing lipids, especially triglycerides.\nEnhances palmitate-induced inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis.\nInhibits cholesterol biosynthesis at the level of b-hydroxy-b-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase.\nThe gamma-glutamylcysteines are the compounds in garlic that may lower blood pressure, as indicated by their ability to inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme in-vitro. Garlic modulates the production and function of both endothelium derived relaxing and constricting factors and this may contribute to its protective effect against hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction.\nGarlic elicits nitric-oxide-dependent relaxation in pulmonary arteries. It increases nitric oxide through activation of nitric oxide synthase activity.\nFructans can inhibit adenosine deaminase in isolated cells, thus increasing adenosine and its associated blood vessel dilatory activity",
    "dosage": "1 to 2 capsules daily for 8 to 18 weeks or as advised by the physician",
    "interaction": "Concurrent use of garlic and antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants might increase the potential for prolonged bleeding. Blood clotting times have been reported to double in patients taking warfarin and garlic suppliments",

Lutein and Zeaxanthin are especially concentrated in rods which are specialized light sensitive cell or photoprotector in retina and responsible for black and white vision in the dark. Scientific evidence clearly suggests that Lutein and Zeaxanthin has important role in the retina to protect tissue from the damaging effects of high-energy blue spectrum light. The uncontrolled generation of free radicals in the eye and harmful light are believed to ultimately lead to age related macular degeneration (AMD), cataracts, retinitis pigmentosa.

Vitis vinifera is the principal herb of Mahadrakkharist belongs to Vitaceae family is a perennial woody vine native to Asia and then introduced in Europe and other continents. It is familiar as grapes or Drakkha in Bangladesh.Chemical constituents: The chemical analysis has shown the presence of proanthocyanidins (PCOs) including procyanidins, anthocyanins, flavanoids. 3-oxo-a-ionol, vomifoliol and dehydrovomifoliol were identified for the first time in fruit from Vitis vinifera. Therapeutically active constituent, resveratrol is isolated from the skin of Grapes.",
    "pharmacology": "Grapes contain beneficial bioflaVonoid-like ingredients called \"proanthocyanidins\" (PCOs or OPCs). Proanthocyanidins are believed to protect cell membranes by neutralizing particularly harmful free radicals called \"lipid peroxides\". PCOs may strengthen the capillary walls and skin. It has been reported to inhibit the release of inflammatory chemicals, such as histamine and prostaglandins. PCOs have been used in allergies and asthma because of their reported ability to slow histamine release from mast cells. Resveratrol, a molecule has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that may protect against COPD and asthma (Wood 2010). A cell culture study found that resveratrol inhibited the release of all measured inflammatory mediators (cytokines) from immune cells extracted from the alveoli of smokers and non-smokers with COPD. Moreover, while resveratrol attenuates the release of inflammatory mediators in airway smooth muscle cells, it preserves signaling of a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which may be protective against emphysema. More recently, the anti-inflammatory effects of resveratrol have been associated with inhibition of the transcription factor NF-kB, possibly mediated via the inhibition of l-kB kinase. Resveratrol has several activities that may account for its possible cardioprotective action. These include inhibition of the oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation and inhibition of platelet aggregation. Resveratrol also has been found to exert a strong inhibitory effect on superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide production by macrophages stimulated by lipopolysaccharides or phorbol esters. It also increases nitric oxide and decreases lactate dehydrogenase levels in the carotid blood and effective against ischemia-reperfusion induced arrythmias. Triterpenes roxburghiadiol A and B isolated from this plant Aglaia roxburghiana has the potent anti-inflammatory activity and mast cell degranulation induced by A. roxburghiana extracts and the triterpenes.Pharmacokinetics: From animal and limited human studies,it appears that resveratrol is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract following its ingestion. Resveratrol is found in the form of a glucuronide conjugate after crossing the small intestine and entering the blood circulation. In case of human, five metabolites of resveratrolTiave been detected in urine, such as resveratrol monosulphate, two isomeric forms of resveratrol monoglucuronide, dihydroresveratrol monosulphate and dihydroresveratrol monoglucuronide. 56% sulphate and glucuronide conjugates excrete through urine (Baur and Sinclair,2006)",
    "dosage": "Mahadrakkharist content of grapes is partly responsible for the therapeutic effect. The Daily recommended dose of resveratrol is 8 mg/kg body weight. Each 5 ml syrup contains 36 mg resveratrol as a fluid extract. So the daily recommended dose is-\n\nChildren under 12 years: 1-2 teaspoonfuls (5-10 ml) 2 times daily after meal.\nAbove 12 years and Adult: 3-4 teaspoonfuls (15-20 ml) 2 times daily after meal for 4-8 weeks or as directed by the physician.",
    "interaction": "It should be used cautiously in patients taking anticoagulants such as warfarin, aspirin, non-steroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), ACE inhibitors or anti-platelet agents. Based on animal studies, grape seed may increase the risk of bleeding. PCOs may theoretically alter the effectiveness of prescribed blood pressure medications that are angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.",
    "contraindications": "",
    "side_effects": "There are no side effects associated with the use of Drakkha in the above-mentioned therapeutic doses. Drakkha has been used safely as an ayurvedic medicine for hundreds of years. But in very rare case stomach pain, headache and an allergic reaction have been reported.",

Capsicum oleoresin is prepared by extracting the crushed capsicum with volatile solvents by percolation method. Preparation made from the oleoresin in cayenne and oleoresin's isolated constituent 'Capsaicin' is used as topical analgesic in OTC (over the counter) market. The herb is indigenous to Mexico and Central America. Methyl salicylate, menthol and camphor are originally derived from plants. Methyl salicylate is derived from oil of wintergreen, menthol is derived from mint and camphor is derived from a number of plants including Peppermint, Eucalyptus and Cedar.",
    "pharmacology": "Capsicum species are known to be very strong local stimulants in the circulatory system. Its reduction of thromboxane B2 formation and erythrocyte hemolysis suggests a membrane stabilizing property that interferes with the activation of phospholipase A2. Capsicum activates nociceptive fbres, which induces the release of excitatory neurotransmitters, bind to specific vanilloid (capsaicin) receptors and its effects are reversible. Capsicum induces selective analgesic effect by depleting substance P, a neuropeptide of 11 amino acids that mediates the transmission and modulation of pain impulses from the peripheral nerves to the spinal column. Capsicum initially stimulates substance P release from peripheral sensory C type nerve fibers, then prevents its re-uptake and also blocks its transport within the neuron, which causes its eventual depletion resulting in analgesia. Methyl salicylic acid is similar to that of Aspirin that shows anesthetic properties by blocking the voltage-operated sodium channels in pain-receptor neurons.Menthol molecule binds and stimulates the TRPM-8 receptor protein that produces a sensation of cold (pain in extreme cases) when stimulated.Camphor has been approved by FDA for topical use as a pain reliever and anesthetic. It acts as counter irritant and numbs the nerve endings that inhibit the transmission of pain sensation.",

It shows the following actions:Anti-toxin activity: S. boulardii produces proteins that work to neutralize bacterial toxins. This may include the toxins produced by Clostridium diffcile.Anti-microbial: S. boulardii adheres to pathogens, which decreases their adhesion to the intestinal wall and decreases invasion of enterocytes into the body. These pathogens are then removed during bowel movements.Enzymatic activity: In healthy adults, S. boulardii increases the enzymatic activities (lactase, alpha glucosidase, alkaline phosphatase). The production of intestinal polyamines by S. boulardii is one of its most relevant and specific mechanisms of action. The polyamines spermidine, spermine, and putrescine enhance the expression of brush border enzymes (such as hydrolases, proteases, and transport molecules).Immune Enhancement: S. boulardii helps prevent infection by stimulating the immune system along the GI lining by increasing the protective antibody IgA.Anti-inflammatory: S. boulardii causes a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines.",

    "description": "Spirulina is a simple one-called microscopic blue green algae with the scientific name Arthrospira Platensis. Under a microscope, spirulina appears as long, thin, blue green spiral threads. It is mostly found in Asia, Africa and central America. Because of its hundreds of health benefits, it is called \"future food\" or \"super food\". Spirulina is often deemed the most nutritionally complete of all food supplements, containing a rich supply of many important nutrients, including protein, complex carbohydrates, iron and vitamins. It contains much more vitamins than a typical synthetic vitam in or any vegetarian meal. It also has essential and non-essential amino acids that are ten times more than meat. It also has a high supply of carotenoids such as beta carotene and yellow xanthophylls which have antioxidant properties. It is also rich in Chlorophyll, fatty and nucleic acids and lipids.",
    "pharmacology": "Spirulina has such positive TTutritionafcontent that it is called the world's richest whole-food which can be found naturally. It is very high in protein with low calorie content (only coming in at 2.9 calories per gram) using this as a supplement for protein specifically this is less than % the amount of calories in protein per gram, Spirulina is the highest source of B-12, essential for healthy nerves and tissue, especially for vegetarians. Due to large amount of iron in spirulina, it helps to promote the creation of new red blood cells too. Not only does spirulina contain high protein content within it, but it also has nutrients in it which increase the body's ability to absorb protein, This means that it even makes any other protein being consumed by the person more effective than if they had just consumed the protein alone. ln this way, spirulina may even be a better source of protein than most meal. Spirulina contains a concentration of very single amino acid as well. These are amino acids that the body cannot survive without, but we cannot produce ourselves which means we have to get them through other dietary means. Spirulina contains approximately 100 nutrients and minerals. Furthermore it has fatty acids that help reduce bad cholesterol in our body and antioxidants that help strengthen our immune system, fight free radicals and slow down the aging process. It is recommended to people whose intake of nutritious food is anadequate.How does it work-\n\nAbout 60% of spirulina dry weight is protein which is essential for growth and cell regeneration. Besides this it had sufficient vitamins and minerals within, With its high digestibility, spirulina has proven to fight malnutrition in impoverished communities by helping the body absorb nutrients when it has lost its ability to absorb normal forms of food.\nEvery 10 grams of spirulina can supply up to 70% of the minimum daily requirements for iron. Being rich in iron, magnesium and trace minerals spirulina is easier to absorb than iron supplements to fight anemia effectively.\nSpirulina is rich in gamma-linolenic acid or GLA, a compound found in breast milk that helps develop healthier babies.\nAnother health benefit of spirulina is that it stimulates beneficial flora like lactobacillus and bifidobacterial in our digestive tract to promote healthy digestion and proper bowel function. It acts as a natural cleanser by eliminating mercury and other deadly toxins commonly ingested by the body.",

Undenatured collagen II has unique mechanism of action. Undenatured collagen II molecules contain active binding sites called epitopes which trigger the process of oral tolerization. Through oral tolerization process, active epitopes of undenatured collagen II interact with Peyer’s patches (lymphoid tissue) of small intestine to release collagen-specific regulatory T-cells. Collagen-specific regulatory T-cells then migrate to joint areas and prevent release of T-cells.Preventing the release of T-cells prevent the secretion of collagenase enzymes by macrophages responsible for breakdown of collagen in joint cartilage. It also slows the production of inflammatory cytokines resulting in reduction of inflammation, halting the erosion of joint cartilage and promote cartilage rebuilding. Undenatured Type II Collagen supports joint function, mobility and flexibilityand  also improves knee extension by up to 10% for better range of motion.

    "description": "",
    "pharmacology": "Collagen type II (native) is a protein that is part of the cartilage, bone & other types of connective tissues. Type II collagen, like all collagen, is made up of three chains of amino acids: glycine, proline and hydroxyproline, which is known as a triple helix. Undenatured type II chicken collagen is a nutritional supplement derived from chicken sternum cartilage using a patented, low temperature, non-enzymatic manufacturing process that preserves the natural triple helix molecular configuration and its biological activities. Boswellic acids are the major constituents of the gum derived from the plant Boswellia serrata Roxb. The gum resin comprises of ß-boswellic acids as the main triterpenic acid along with 11-keto-ß-boswellic acids and their acetates.Type II collagen acts as an antigen, causing an autoimmune response that stimulates the production of anti-inflammatory cell-signaling proteins called cytokines. Undenatured collagen type II has unique mechanism of action. Undenatured collagen type II molecules contain active binding sites called epitopes which trigger the process of oral tolerization. Through oral tolerization process, active epitopes of undenatured collagen type II interact with Peyer’s patches (lymphoid tissue) of small intestine to release collagen-specific regulatory T-cells. Collagen- specific regulatory T-cells then migrate to joint areas and prevent release of T-cells.Preventing the release of T-cells prevent the secretion of collagenase enzymes by macrophages responsible for breakdown of collagen in joint cartilage. It also slows the production of inflammatory cytokines resulting in reduction of inflammation, halting the erosion of joint cartilage and promote cartilage rebuilding. Undenatured collagen type II supports joint function, mobility and flexibility and also improves knee extension by up to 10% for better range of motion. It also relieves joint pain due to strenuous exercise. Chicken collagen also contains the chondroitin & glucosamine which help in rebuilding cartilage. The resinous part of Boswellia serrata possesses monoterpenes, diterpenes, triterpenes, tetracyclic triterpenic acids and four major pentacyclic triterpenic acids i.e. β-boswellic acid, acetyl-β-boswellic acid, 11-keto-β-boswellic acid & acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid, responsible for inhibition of pro-inflammatory enzymes.",

Chondroitin is another naturally occurring mucopolysaccharide of cartilage that stimulates cartilage production, inhibits cartilage destroying enzymes, draws fuid to the cells and helps lubricate the joints. Glucosamine and Chondroitin work synergistically together to help stimulate the production and regeneration of connective tissues (e.g., cartilage, bone, tendon, skin, mucous membrane, blood vessels etc.).

    "pharmacology": "Undenatured Collagen II is derived from chicken sternum cartilage that prevents the breakdown of bone joint cartilage by releasing collagen-specific T-regulatory cells. It also slows the production of inflammatory cytokines. The therapeutic potential of Undenatured Collagen II in joint disease depends on a specific dose of 40 mg. Glucosamine is the essential building block of joint cartilage that additionally reduces the synthesis of inflammatory and degenerative mediators responsible for the breakdown of the cartilage. Chondroitin is a structural component of cartilage that maintains water and nutrients to promote elasticity and resistance in cartilage. It protects cartilage from premature decline by preventing the matrix metalloproteinase enzyme. Methylsulfonylmethane is necessary to maintain and repair healthy joints, tendons, ligaments, and connective tissues. It reduces the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and nitric oxide by suppressing the nuclear factor-kappa β, thus producing an analgesic and anti-inflammatory effect in reducing osteoarthritis pain and swelling.

It also slows the production of infammatory cytokines resulting in reduction of infammation, halting the erosion of joint cartilage and promote cartilage rebuilding. Hyaluronic acid is naturally present throughout the human body. In the joints, hyaluronic acid has several functions, including:Lubrication: Hyaluronic acid binds well to water, producing a viscous, jelly-like consistency. This viscous fuid provides lubrication and also acts as a shock absorber within the joint. Growth of cartilage and bone: Hyaluronic acid helps in the growth and development of joint’s cartilage and bone by promoting the growth of new cells and tissues. Reducing infammation: Hyaluronic acid plays an important role in reducing joint infammation and pain caused by injury or tissue degeneration. Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) has anti-infammatory and antioxidant efects. Sulphur, which is a major component of MSM, plays an important role in making collagen and glucosamine, both of which are vital for healthy bones and joints. In clinical study, MSM shows signifcant decrease in WOMAC pain and physical function impairment. Turmeric extract contains curcumin which has anti-infammatory, antithrombotic, antioxidant, and antimicrobial activities. The anti-infammatory efects of curcumin are believed to be a result of inhibiting pro-infammatory signals such as prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and cyclooxygenase-2. In addition, curcumin has been demonstrated to suppress several pro-infammatory cytokines and mediators of their release such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), IL-1, IL-8, and nitric oxide synthase.Boswellic acid is the active ingredient in Boswellia serrata which has signifcant pharmacological activity in the treatment of infammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and other infammatory conditions.
